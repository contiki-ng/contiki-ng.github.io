<p>The ContikiNG build system is designed to make it easy to compile ContikiNG applications for either to a hardware platform or into a simulation platform by simply supplying different parameters to the <code>make</code> command, without having to edit makefiles or modify the application code. </p>
<p>The file example project in examples/hello-world/ shows how the ContikiNG build system works. The <code><a class="el" href="a00062_source.html">hello-world.c</a></code> application can be built into a complete ContikiNG system by running <code>make</code> in the examples/hello-world/ directory. Running <code>make</code> without parameters will build a ContikiNG system using the <code>native</code> target. The <code>native</code> target is a special ContikiNG platform that builds an entire ContikiNG system as a program that runs on the development system. After compiling the application for the <code>native</code> target it is possible to run the ContikiNG system with the application by running the file <code>hello-world.native</code>.</p>
<p>To compile the hello-world application into a stand-alone executable that can be loaded into a running ContikiNG system, the command <code>make hello-world.ce</code> is used. To build an executable file for the Sky platform, <code>make TARGET=sky hello-world.sky</code> is run.</p>
<p>To avoid having to type <code>TARGET=</code> every time <code>make</code> is run, it is possible to run <code>make TARGET=sky savetarget</code> to save the selected target as the default target platform for subsequent invocations of <code>make</code>. A file called <code>Makefile.target</code> containing the currently saved target is saved in the project's directory.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="buildsystem-makefiles"></a>
Makefiles used in the ContikiNG build system</h1>
<p>The ContikiNG build system is composed of a number of Makefiles. These are:</p><ul>
<li><code>Makefile</code>: the project's makefile, located in the project directory.</li>
<li><code>Makefile.include</code>: the system-wide ContikiNG makefile, located in the root of the ContikiNG source tree.</li>
<li><code>Makefile.$(TARGET)</code> (where $(TARGET) is the name of the platform that is currently being built): rules for the specific platform, located in the platform's subdirectory in the platform/ directory.</li>
<li><code>Makefile.$(CPU)</code> (where $(CPU) is the name of the CPU or microcontroller architecture used on the platform for which ContikiNG is built): rules for the CPU architecture, located in the CPU architecture's subdirectory in the cpu/ directory.</li>
<li><code>Makefile.$(MODULE)</code> (where $(MODULE) is the name of a module in the Contiki directory): rules for modules in the Contiki directories. Each module might have its own optional makefile.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Makefile in the project's directory is intentionally simple. It specifies where the ContikiNG source code resides in the system and includes the system-wide Makefile, <code>Makefile.include</code>. The project's makefile can also define in the <code>MODULES</code> variable a list of modules that should be included in the ContikiNG system. The Makefile used in the hello-world example project looks like this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">CONTIKI = ../..</div><div class="line">all: hello-world</div><div class="line">include $(CONTIKI)/Makefile.include</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>First, the location of the ContikiNG source code tree is given by defining the <code>CONTIKI</code> variable. Next, the name of the application is defined. Finally, the system-wide <code>Makefile.include</code> is included.</p>
<p>The <code>Makefile.include</code> contains definitions of the C files of the core ContikiNG system. <code>Makefile.include</code> always reside in the root of the ContikiNG source tree. When <code>make</code> is run, <code>Makefile.include</code> includes the <code>Makefile.$(TARGET)</code> as well as all makefiles for the modules in the <code>MODULES</code> list (which is specified by the project's <code>Makefile</code>).</p>
<p><code>Makefile.$(TARGET)</code>, which is located in the platform/$(TARGET)/ directory, contains the list of C files that the platform adds to the ContikiNG system. This list is defined by the <code>CONTIKI_TARGET_SOURCEFILES</code> variable. The <code>Makefile.$(TARGET)</code> also includes the <code>Makefile.$(CPU)</code> from the cpu/$(CPU)/ directory.</p>
<p>The <code>Makefile.$(CPU)</code> typically contains definitions for the C compiler used for the particular CPU. If multiple C compilers are used, the <code>Makefile.$(CPU)</code> can either contain a conditional expression that allows different C compilers to be defined, or it can be completely overridden by the platform specific makefile <code>Makefile.$(TARGET)</code>. </p>
