<div class="textblock"><p>Contiki-NG is an operating system for resource-constrained devices in the Internet of Things. Contiki-NG contains a low-power IPv6 communication stack, <a class="el" href="group__uip.html">uIP</a>. uIP is a small RFC-compliant TCP/IP stack that makes it possible for Contiki-NG to communicate over the Internet. The system runs on a variety of platforms based on energy-efficient architectures such as the ARM Cortex-M3 and the Texas Instruments MSP430. The code footprint is on the order of a 100 kb, and the memory usage can be configured to be as low as 10 kb.</p>
<p>In 2017, Contiki-NG started as a fork of the Contiki operating system with the purpose of making a system focused on standard low-power IPv6 communication in the IoT. Another important goal is to have a regular release cycle and enhanced documentation. Although both systems at the beginning have many common interfaces and modules, we expect them to diverge considerably in the future.</p>
<p>Most of Contiki-NG is written in the standard C programming language, with the exception of some architecture-specific code that may use compiler extensions and assembly language. The source code is available as open source with a 3-clause BSD license.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="mainpage-getting-started"></a>
Getting started with Contiki-NG</h1>
<p>Contiki-NG is designed to run on many different <a class="el" href="group__platform.html">platforms</a>. It is also possible to compile and build both the Contiki-NG system and Contiki-NG applications on many different development platforms.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="mainpage-building"></a>
Building the Contiki-NG system and its applications</h1>
<p>The Contiki-NG build system is designed to make it easy to compile Contiki-NG applications for either to a hardware platform or into a simulation platform by simply supplying different parameters to the <code>make</code> command, without having to edit makefiles or modify the application code.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="group__buildsystem.html">The Contiki-NG build system</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="mainpage-tcpip"></a>
Low-Power IPv6 Networking</h1>
<p>One of the main features of Contiki-NG is a resource-efficient IPv6 network stack designed for lossy and low-power networks. The network stack comprises protocols such as IPv6, TCP, UDP, DNS, RPL, CoAP, LWM2M, and Websockets. Beneath the IPv6 stack, Contiki-NG supports IEEE 802.15.4 wireless communication with Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH).</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="mainpage-threads"></a>
Application Development</h1>
<p>Applications in Contiki-NG are implemented using processes, which are based on a programming abstraction called Protothreads. Protothreads is essentially a lightweight stackless thread-like construct, allowing highly efficient context switching.</p>
<p>A process is scheduled by an event-driven kernel after an event has been sent to the process, either from the kernel of from another process. Such events can be the result of a timer expiring, a sensor value changing, or a network packet having been received. Once scheduled, each process is responsible for yielding control back to the scheduler without executing for too long, which is typically done by waiting for an event. Alternatively, applications can also use the <a class="el" href="group__mt.html">Multi-threading library</a>, which supports a more traditional thread model with one stack per thread.</p>
